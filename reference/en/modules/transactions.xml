    <para>
        Hibernate is not itself a database. It is a lightweight object-relational
        mapping tool. Transaction management is delegated to the underlying database
        connection. If the connection is enlisted with JTA, operations performed by the
        <literal>Session</literal> are atomically part of the wider JTA
        transaction. Hibernate can be seen as a thin adapter to JDBC, adding object-
        oriented semantics.

            A <literal>SessionFactory</literal> is an expensive-to-create, threadsafe object 
            intended to be shared by all application threads. A <literal>Session</literal> 
            is an inexpensive, non-threadsafe object that should be used once, for a single
            business process, and then discarded. For example, when using Hibernate in a 
            servlet-based application, servlets could obtain a <literal>SessionFactory</literal> 
            using

        <para>
            Each call to a service method could create a new <literal>Session</literal>,
            <literal>flush()</literal> it, <literal>commit()</literal> its connection,
            <literal>close()</literal> it and finally discard it. (The <literal>SessionFactory</literal>
            may also be kept in JNDI or in a static <emphasis>Singleton</emphasis> helper variable.)
        </para>

        <para>
            In a stateless session bean, a similar approach could be used. The bean would
            obtain a <literal>SessionFactory</literal> in <literal>setSessionContext()</literal>. 
            Then each business method would create a <literal>Session</literal>,
            <literal>flush()</literal> it and <literal>close()</literal> it. Of course, the 
            application should not <literal>commit()</literal> the connection. (Leave that to 
            JTA, the database connection participates automatically in container-managed
            transactions.)
        </para>

        <para>
            We use the Hibernate <literal>Transaction</literal> API as discussed previously,
            a single <literal>commit()</literal> of a Hibernate <literal>Transaction</literal>
            flushes the state and commits any underlying database connection (with special
            handling of JTA transactions).
        </para>

        <para>
            Ensure you understand the semantics of <literal>flush()</literal>.
            Flushing synchronizes the persistent store with in-memory changes but
            <emphasis>not</emphasis> vice-versa. Note that for all Hibernate JDBC
            connections/transactions, the transaction isolation level for that connection
            applies to all operations executed by Hibernate!

        <para>
            The next few sections will discuss alternative approaches that utilize versioning
            to ensure transaction atomicity. These are considered "advanced" approaches to
            be used with care.

                    track of updates made to loaded objects, so a different <literal>Session</literal>

        <title>Considering object identity</title>

        <para>
            The application may concurrently access the same persistent state in two
            different units-of-work. However, an instance of a persistent class is never shared
            between two <literal>Session</literal> instances. Hence there are
            two different notions of identity:
        </para>

        <variablelist spacing="compact">

        <para>
            Then for objects attached to a <emphasis>particular</emphasis> <literal>Session</literal>,
            the two notions are equivalent. However, while the application might concurrently access
            the "same" (persistent identity) business object in two different sessions, the two
            instances will actually be "different" (JVM identity).
        </para>
        <para>
            This approach leaves Hibernate and the database to worry about concurrency. The
            application never needs to synchronize on any business object, as long as it sticks to a
            single thread per <literal>Session</literal> or object identity (within a
            <literal>Session</literal> the  application may safely use <literal>==</literal> to
            compare objects).

        <title>Optimistic concurrency control</title>

        <para>
            Many business processes require a whole series of interactions with the user
            interleaved with database accesses. In web and enterprise applications it is
            not acceptable for a database transaction to span a user interaction.
        </para>

        <para>
            Maintaining isolation of business processes becomes the partial responsibility
            of the application tier, hence we call this process a long running
            <emphasis>application transaction</emphasis>. A single application transaction
            usually spans several database transactions. It will be atomar if only one of
            these database transactions (the last one) stores the updated data, all others
            simply read data.
        </para>

        <para>
            The only approach that is consistent with high concurrency and high
            scalability is optimistic concurrency control with versioning. Hibernate
            provides for three possible approaches to writing application code that
            uses optimistic concurrency.

                A single <literal>Session</literal> instance and its persistent instances are
                used for the whole application transaction.
            </para>

            <para>
                The <literal>Session</literal> uses optimistic locking with versioning to
                ensure that many database transactions appear to the application as a single
                logical application transaction. The <literal>Session</literal> is disconnected
                from any underlying JDBC connection when waiting for user interaction. This
                approach is the most efficient in terms of database access. The application
                need not concern itself with version checking or with reattaching detached
                instances.

            <para>
                The <literal>foo</literal> object still knows which <literal>Session</literal>
                it was loaded it. As soon as the <literal>Session</literal> has a JDBC connection,
                we commit the changes to the object.
            </para>

            <para>
                This pattern is problematic if our <literal>Session</literal> is too big to
                be stored during user think time, e.g. an <literal>HttpSession</literal> should
                be kept as small as possible. As the <literal>Session</literal> is also the
                (mandatory) first-level cache and contains all loaded objects, we can propably
                use this strategy only for a few request/response cycles. This is indeed
                recommended, as the <literal>Session</literal> will soon also have stale data.

                Each interaction with the persistent store occurs in a new <literal>Session</literal>. 
                However, the same persistent instances are reused for each interaction with the database.
                The application manipulates the state of detached instances originally loaded in another
                <literal>Session</literal> and then "reassociates" them using 
                <literal>Session.update()</literal> or <literal>Session.saveOrUpdate()</literal>.

            <para>
                You may also call <literal>lock()</literal> instead of <literal>update()</literal>
                and use <literal>LockMode.READ</literal> (performing a version check, bypassing all
                caches) if you are sure that the object has not been modified.

                Each interaction with the database occurs in a new <literal>Session</literal>
                that reloads all persistent instances from the database before manipulating them.
                This approach forces the application to carry out its own version checking to ensure 
                application transaction isolation. (Of course, Hibernate will still <emphasis>update</emphasis>
                version numbers for you.) This approach is the least efficient in terms of database access.

                Of course, if you are operating in a low-data-concurrency environment and don't

                check.

            The first approach described above is to maintain a single <literal>Session</literal>

        <para>
            <literal>Session.reconnect()</literal> obtains a new connection (or you may supply one) 
            and restarts the session. After reconnection, to force a version check on data you aren't 
            updating, you may call <literal>Session.lock()</literal> on any objects that might have
            been updated by another transaction. You don't need to lock any data that you

            <literal>Session.lock()</literal> performs a version number check if the specified lock
            mode is <literal>READ</literal>, <literal>UPGRADE</literal> or 
            <literal>UPGRADE_NOWAIT</literal>. (In the case of <literal>UPGRADE</literal> or
            <literal>UPGRADE_NOWAIT</literal>, <literal>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</literal> is used.)

            If the database does not support the requested lock mode, Hibernate will use an appropriate
            alternate mode (instead of throwing an exception). This ensures that applications will
            be portable.
