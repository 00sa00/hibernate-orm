            We've already spent quite some time talking about collections.
            In this section we will highlight a couple more issues about
            how collections behave at runtime.

            <para>Hibernate defines three basic kinds of collections:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>collections of values</para>
            </listitem>

                <para>many to many associations</para>
            </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>
                This classification distinguishes the various table and foreign key
                relationships but does not tell us quite everything we need to know
                about the relational model. To fully understand the relational structure
                and performance characteristics, we must also consider the structure of
                the primary key that is used by Hibernate to update or delete collection
                rows. This suggests the following classification:
            </para>

            <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>indexed collections</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>sets</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>bags</para>
            </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>
                All indexed collections (maps, lists, arrays) have a primary key consisting
                of the <literal>&lt;key&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;index&gt;</literal>
                columns. In this case collection updates are usually extremely efficient -
                the primary key may be efficiently indexed and a particular row may be efficiently
                located when Hibernate tries to update or delete it.
            </para>

            <para>
                Sets have a primary key consisting of <literal>&lt;key&gt;</literal> and element
                columns. This may be less efficient for some types of collection element, particularly
                composite elements or large text or binary fields; the database may not be able to index
                a complex primary key as efficently.  On the other hand, for one to many or many to many
                associations, particularly in the case of synthetic identifiers, it is likely to be just
                as efficient. (Side-note: if you want <literal>SchemaExport</literal> to actually create
                the primary key of a <literal>&lt;set&gt;</literal> for you, you must declare all columns
                as <literal>not-null="true"</literal>.)
            </para>

            <para>
                Bags are the worst case. Since a bag permits duplicate element values and has no
                index column, no primary key may be defined. Hibernate has no way of distinguishing
                between duplicate rows. Hibernate resolves this problem by completely removing
                (in a single <literal>DELETE</literal>) and recreating the collection whenever it
                changes. This might be very inefficient.
            </para>

            <para>
                Note that for a one-to-many association, the "primary key" may not be the physical
                primary key of the database table - but even in this case, the above classification
                is still useful. (It still reflects how Hibernate "locates" individual rows of the
                collection.)
            </para>

        </sect2>

        <sect2 id="performance-collections-mostefficientupdate">
            <title>Lists, maps and sets are the most efficient collections to update</title>

            <para>
                From the discussion above, it should be clear that indexed collections
                and (usually) sets allow the most efficient operation in terms of adding,
                removing and updating elements.
            </para>

            <para>
                There is, arguably, one more advantage that indexed collections have over sets for
                many to many associations or collections of values. Because of the structure of a
                <literal>Set</literal>, Hibernate doesn't ever <literal>UPDATE</literal> a row when
                an element is "changed". Changes to a <literal>Set</literal> always work via
                <literal>INSERT</literal> and <literal>DELETE</literal> (of individual rows). Once
                again, this consideration does not apply to one to many associations.
            </para>

            <para>
                After observing that arrays cannot be lazy, we would conclude that lists, maps and sets
                are the most performant collection types. (With the caveat that a set might be less
                efficient for some collections of values.)
            </para>

            <para>
                Sets are expected to be the most common kind of collection in Hibernate applications.
            </para>

            <para>
                <emphasis>There is an undocumented feature in this release of Hibernate. The
                <literal>&lt;idbag&gt;</literal> mapping implements bag semantics for a collection
                of values or a many to many association and is more efficient that any other
                style of collection in this case!</emphasis>
            </para>

        <sect2 id="performance-collections-mostefficentinverse">
            <title>Bags and lists are the most efficient inverse collections</title>

            <para>
                Just before you ditch bags forever, there is a particular case in which bags (and also lists)
                are much more performant than sets. For a collection with <literal>inverse="true"</literal>
                (the standard bidirectional one-to-many relationship idiom, for example) we can add elements
                to a bag or list without needing to initialize (fetch) the bag elements! This is because
                <literal>Collection.add()</literal> or <literal>Collection.addAll()</literal> must always
                return true for a bag or <literal>List</literal> (unlike a <literal>Set</literal>). This can
                make the following common code much faster.
            </para>

            <programlisting><![CDATA[Parent p = (Parent) sess.load(Parent.class, id);
    Child c = new Child();

    sess.flush();]]></programlisting>

        <sect2 id="performance-collections-oneshotdelete">
            <title>One shot delete</title>

            <para>
                Occasionally, deleting collection elements one by one can be extremely inefficient. Hibernate
                isn't completly stupid, so it knows not to do that in the case of an newly-empty collection
                (if you called <literal>list.clear()</literal>, for example). In this case, Hibernate will
                issue a single <literal>DELETE</literal> and we are done!
            </para>

            <para>
                Suppose we add a single element to a collection of size twenty and then remove two elements.
                Hibernate will issue one <literal>INSERT</literal> statement and two <literal>DELETE</literal>
                statements (unless the collection is a bag). This is certainly desirable.
            </para>

            <para>
                However, suppose that we remove eighteen elements, leaving two and then add thee new elements.
                There are two possible ways to proceed
            </para>

            <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>delete eighteen rows one by one and then insert three rows</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>remove the whole collection (in one SQL <literal>DELETE</literal>) and insert
                all five current elements (one by one)</para>
            </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>
                Hibernate isn't smart enough to know that the second option is probably quicker in this case.
                (And it would probably be undesirable for Hibernate to be that smart; such behaviour might
                confuse database triggers, etc.)
            </para>

            <para>
                Fortunately, you can force this behaviour (ie. the second strategy) at any time by discarding
                (ie. dereferencing) the original collection and returning a newly instantiated collection with
                all the current elements. This can be very useful and powerful from time to time.

    <para>
        We have already shown how you can use lazy initialization for persistent collections
        in the chapter about collection mappings. A similar effect is achievable for ordinary object
        references, using CGLIB proxies. We have also mentioned how Hibernate caches persistent
        objects at the level of a <literal>Session</literal>. More aggressive caching strategies
        may be configured upon a class-by-class basis.
    </para>
    
    <para>
        In the next section, we show you how to use these features, which may be used to
        achieve much higher performance, where necessary.

        <title>Proxies for Lazy Initialization</title>

        <para>
            Hibernate implements lazy initializing proxies for persistent objects using runtime
            bytecode enhancement (via the excellent CGLIB library).
        </para>

        <para>
            The mapping file declares a class or interface to use as the proxy interface
            for that class. The recommended approach is to specify the class itself:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[<class name="eg.Order" proxy="eg.Order">]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            The runtime type of the proxies will be a subclass of <literal>Order</literal>. Note that
            the proxied class must implement a default constructor with at least package visibility.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            There are some gotchas to be aware of when extending this approach to polymorphic
            classes, eg.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<class name="eg.Cat" proxy="eg.Cat">
    ......
    <subclass name="eg.DomesticCat" proxy="eg.DomesticCat">
        .....
    </subclass>
</class>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Firstly, instances of <literal>Cat</literal> will never be castable to 
            <literal>DomesticCat</literal>, even if the underlying instance is an
            instance of <literal>DomesticCat</literal>.
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[Cat cat = (Cat) session.load(Cat.class, id);  // instantiate a proxy (does not hit the db)
if ( cat.isDomesticCat() ) {                  // hit the db to initialize the proxy
    DomesticCat dc = (DomesticCat) cat;       // Error!
    ....
}]]></programlisting>
    
        <para>
            Secondly, it is possible to break proxy <literal>==</literal>.
        </para>
            
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
Cat cat = (Cat) session.load(Cat.class, id);            // instantiate a Cat proxy
DomesticCat dc = 
    (DomesticCat) session.load(DomesticCat.class, id);  // required new DomesticCat proxy!
System.out.println(cat==dc);                            // false]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            However, the situation is not quite as bad as it looks. Even though we now have two references
            to different proxy objects, the underlying instance will still be the same object:
        </para>
    
        <programlisting><![CDATA[cat.setWeight(11.0);  // hit the db to initialize the proxy
System.out.println( dc.getWeight() );  // 11.0]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Third, you may not use a CGLIB proxy for a <literal>final</literal> class or a class
            with any <literal>final</literal> methods.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Finally, if your persistent object acquires any resources upon instantiation (eg. in 
            initializers or default constructor), then those resources will also be acquired by
            the proxy. The proxy class is an actual subclass of the persistent class.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            These problems are all due to fundamental limitations in Java's single inheritence model.
            If you wish to avoid these problems your persistent classes must each implement an interface 
            that declares its business methods. You should specify these interfaces in the mapping file. eg.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<class name="eg.Cat" proxy="eg.ICat">
    ......
    <subclass name="eg.DomesticCat" proxy="eg.IDomesticCat">
        .....
    </subclass>
</class>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            where <literal>Cat</literal> implements the interface <literal>ICat</literal> and
            <literal>DomesticCat</literal> implements the interface <literal>IDomesticCat</literal>. Then 
            proxies for instances of <literal>Cat</literal> and <literal>DomesticCat</literal> may be returned 
            by <literal>load()</literal> or <literal>iterate()</literal>. (Note that <literal>find()</literal> 
            does not return proxies.)
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[ICat cat = (ICat) session.load(Cat.class, catid);
Iterator iter = session.iterate("from cat in class eg.Cat where cat.name='fritz'");
ICat fritz = (ICat) iter.next();]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            Relationships are also lazily initialized. This means you must declare any properties to be of 
            type <literal>ICat</literal>, not <literal>Cat</literal>.
        </para>
        
        <para>

        <para>
            Sometimes we need to ensure that a proxy or collection is initialized before closing the

            <literal>cat.getSex()</literal> or <literal>cat.getKittens().size()</literal>, for example.
            But that is confusing to readers of the code and is not convenient for generic code.
            The static methods <literal>Hibernate.initialize()</literal> and <literal>Hibernate.isInitialized()</literal>
            provide the application with a convenient way of working with lazyily initialized collections or
            proxies. <literal>Hibernate.initialize(cat)</literal> will force the initialization of a proxy,
            <literal>cat</literal>, as long as its <literal>Session</literal> is still open.
            <literal>Hibernate.initialize( cat.getKittens() )</literal> has a similar effect for the collection

        <title>The Second Level Cache</title>

        <para>
            A Hibernate <literal>Session</literal> is a transaction-level cache of persistent data. It is
            possible to configure a cluster or JVM-level (<literal>SessionFactory</literal>-level) cache on 
            a class-by-class and collection-by-collection basis. You may even plug in a clustered cache. Be 
            careful. Caches are never aware of changes made to the persistent store by another application

            By default, Hibernate uses EHCache for JVM-level caching. (JCS support is now deprecated and will

        <title>The Query Cache</title>

        <para>
            Query result sets may also be cached. This is only useful for queries that are run
            frequently with the same parameters. To use the query cache you must first enable it
            by setting the property <literal>hibernate.cache.use_query_cache=true</literal>. This
            causes the creation of two cache regions - one holding cached query result sets 
            (<literal>org.hibernate.cache.QueryCache</literal>), the other holding timestamps
            of most recent updates to queried tables 
            (<literal>org.hibernate.cache.UpdateTimestampsCache</literal>). Note that the query
            cache does not cache the state of any entities in the result set; it caches only 
            identifier values and results of value type. So the query cache is usually used in
            conjunction with the second-level cache.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Most queries do not benefit from caching, so by default queries are not cached. To
            enable caching, call <literal>Query.setCacheable(true)</literal>. This call allows
            the query to look for existing cache results or add its results to the cache when
            it is executed.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            If you require fine-grained control over query cache expiration policies, you may
            specify a named cache region for a particular query by calling 
            <literal>Query.setCacheRegion()</literal>.
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[List blogs = sess.createQuery("from Blog blog where blog.blogger = :blogger")
    .setEntity("blogger", blogger)
    .setMaxResults(15)
    .setCacheable(true)
    .setCacheRegion("frontpages")
    .list();]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            If the query should force a refresh of its query cache region, you may call
            <literal>Query.setForceCacheRefresh()</literal> to <literal>true</literal>.
            This is particularly useful in cases where underlying data may have been updated
            via a seperate process (i.e., not modified through Hibernate) and allows the
            application to selectively refresh the query cache regions based on its
            knowledge of those events. This is an alternative to eviction of a query
            cache region. If you need fine-grained refresh control for many queries, use
            this function instead of a new region for each query.
