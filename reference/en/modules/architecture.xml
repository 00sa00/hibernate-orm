        <title>Overview</title>
        
        <para>
            A (very) high-level view of the Hibernate architecture:

        <para>
            This diagram shows Hibernate using the database and configuration data to
            provide persistence services (and persistent objects) to the application.
        </para>

        <para>
            We would like to show a more detailed view of the runtime architecture.
            Unfortunately, Hibernate is flexible and supports several approaches. We will
            show the two extremes. The "lite" architecture has the application
            provide its own JDBC connections and manage its own transactions. This approach
            uses a minimal subset of Hibernate's APIs:
        </para>

            </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>
            The "full cream" architecture abstracts the application away from the
            underlying JDBC/JTA APIs and lets Hibernate take care of the details.
        </para>

                            Hibernate offers many optional extension interfaces you can implement to customize
                            the behavior of your persistence layer. See the API documentation for details.

        <para>
            Given a "lite" architecture, the application bypasses the
            <literal>Transaction</literal>/<literal>TransactionFactory</literal> and/or
            <literal>ConnectionProvider</literal> APIs to talk to JTA or JDBC directly.

        <title>Instance states</title>
        <para>
            An instance of a persistent classes may be in one of three different states,
            which are defined with respect to a <emphasis>persistence context</emphasis>.
            The Hibernate <literal>Session</literal> object is the persistence context:

                    <para>
                        The instance is not, and has never been associated with
                        any persistence context. It has no persistent identity
                        (primary key value).

                    <para>
                        The instance is currently associated with a persistence 
                        context. It has a persistent identity (primary key value)
                        and, perhaps, a corresponding row in the database. For a
                        particular persistence context, Hibernate 
                        <emphasis>guarantees</emphasis> that persistent identity
                        is equivalent to Java identity (in-memory location of the
                        object).

                    <para>
                        The instance was once associated with a persistence
                        context, but that context was closed, or the instance
                        was serialized to another process. It has a persistent 
                        identity and, perhaps, a corrsponding row in the database.
                        For detached instances, Hibernate makes no guarantees 
                        about the relationship between persistent identity and
                        Java identity.

        <title>JMX Integration</title>

        <para>
            JMX is the J2EE standard for management of Java components. Hibernate may be managed via
            a JMX standard MBean but because most application servers do not yet support JMX, Hibernate
            also affords some non-standard configuration mechanisms.

        <para>
            Please see the Hibernate website for more information on how to configure Hibernate to
            run as a JMX component inside JBoss. Integration with other JMX containers is also
            possible.
