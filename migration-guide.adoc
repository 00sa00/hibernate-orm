= 5.4 Migration Guide
:toc:

This guide discusses migration from Hibernate ORM version 5.3 to version 5.4.  For migration from
earlier versions, see any other pertinent migration guides as well.

== Background


== Known changes

=== Hibernate Spatial depends on JTS 1.6

Hibernate Spatial depends on the https://github.com/locationtech/jts[Java Topology Suite (JTS)]. In 5.4 this
 dependency has been upgraded to version 1.6. This implies a change in package naming:
 all `com.vividsolutions.jts.\*` packages have been renamed to `org.locationtech.jts.*`.

See https://github.com/locationtech/jts/blob/master/MIGRATION.md[the JTS Migration guide] for more information.
