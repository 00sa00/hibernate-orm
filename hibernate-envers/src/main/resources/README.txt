Hibernate Envers' support has been merged into hibernate-core module, making this hibernate-envers module
obsolete.  This module will be removed in Hibernate 7.0.  It is only kept here for various consumers that
expect a static set of artifact names across a number of Hibernate releases.

See https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-10755
